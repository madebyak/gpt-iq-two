Code Quality Enhancements
Current State: The code quality is generally good, but there are specific areas that could be improved for maintainability.

What I Would Improve:

Consistent Error Handling: Standardize error handling across components. Some parts like the Supabase server client have robust error handling, while others are inconsistent.
Remove Development Artifacts: Clean up console.log statements in production code, particularly in the Sidebar component, while keeping the error logging.
Extract Common Patterns: Create utility functions for repeated code patterns, especially for RTL-specific logic that appears in multiple components.
State Management Refinement: Replace direct DOM manipulation in resize handlers with proper React state management for better predictability.
4. Accessibility Improvements
Current State: Basic accessibility features are implemented, but there are opportunities for improvement.

What I Would Improve:

Enhanced Keyboard Navigation: Ensure all interactive elements can be accessed and operated via keyboard, maintaining focus order that matches visual order in both LTR and RTL modes.
Focus Management: Implement proper focus management when components mount, update, or when modals/dialogs appear.
Consistent ARIA Attributes: Standardize ARIA attributes across all components to ensure screen readers provide a consistent experience.
Color Contrast Validation: Verify all text meets WCAG contrast requirements in both light and dark themes.
5. Authentication and Security Enhancements
Current State: You've implemented a solid Supabase authentication system with both Google OAuth and email/password authentication.

What I Would Improve:

Error Message Clarity: Enhance user-facing error messages for authentication failures without exposing sensitive information.
Session Management: Implement better session timeout handling and refresh mechanisms.
Security Headers: Ensure proper security headers are set for all API routes.
Input Validation: Add more comprehensive input validation on all user inputs, particularly in authentication forms.
6. Internationalization Refinements
Current State: Your internationalization implementation is excellent with proper RTL support and locale-specific configurations.

What I Would Improve:

Translation Coverage: Ensure all user-facing strings are properly extracted into translation files with no hardcoded text.
Date/Time Formatting Consistency: Standardize date and time formatting across all components using the locale information.
Number Formatting: Add proper number formatting based on locale (e.g., thousands separators, decimal points).
RTL Improvements: Further refine RTL-specific styling for edge cases in complex UI components.
7. API Implementation Improvements
Current State: Your API routes are functional but could benefit from standardization.

What I Would Improve:

Consistent Response Format: Standardize API response formats across all endpoints for easier front-end consumption.
Better Error Status Codes: Use appropriate HTTP status codes for different error conditions instead of generic 400/500 errors.
Request Validation: Implement more robust request validation using tools like Zod (which you already have in your dependencies).
Rate Limiting: Add rate limiting to protect against abuse, particularly for authentication endpoints.
