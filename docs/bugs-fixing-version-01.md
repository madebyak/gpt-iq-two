This is a list of the bugs and issues and functions that we need to carefully investigate, examinate, understand the root of the issue then start solving them or implementing them
Please make sure that we every point needs to be investigated systematically, double checking every related codes, files..etc 
always run codebase analysis to understand the compelete system and how it works to ensure zero bugs and conflict implementaion and changing flow

if you check one of the issue and you couldn't determine the root cause of the issue don't jump into conclusions and try to change something just because you think this will solve the issue, instead feel free to ask questions or clarifcation to understand more about the issue 

let's get started:


***issues and bugs:

2. the sidebar in the homepage has on desktop version a hamburger menu which responsible or collapsing / expanding the sidebar, this button is not functional and you need to investigate it furhter
